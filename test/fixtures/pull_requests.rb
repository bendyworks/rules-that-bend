  # The canned pull-request records the stub GitHub CLI serves for
  # BranchRepo, written against the repository after it is built so
  # every head SHA is a real one. A hand-written SHA would compare equal
  # to nothing and turn every rule that reads it into a rule that always
  # rejects, which no verdict would reveal: the branches it decides are
  # KEEP either way.
  #
  # This is the other half of the flat fixture's specification. The
  # repository supplies what git can see, and these records supply what
  # the forge says; expected.txt grades the sweep against both at once.
  #
  # Most records are the only subject some rule of proof (b) has, and
  # dropping one leaves that rule with nothing to decide. Three are not:
  # a-squash-clean, c-merged-main-back and e-stacked-child are settled
  # before proof (b) runs, and deleting them leaves the suite green.
  # They stay because open-pull-request protection queries those
  # branches too, and a project whose pull requests stopped at the
  # interesting branches is not one gh could describe.
