# Loader for the verdict tables under test/fixtures/, which are the
# specification bin/stale-branches is built against: one row per local
# branch, naming the verdict the sweep must reach and the reason key its
# report must carry.
#
# This file lives under test/fixtures/ rather than test/ so CI's
# test/*_test.rb glob does not run it as a suite of its own; it defines
# no tests. Its own tests live in test/stale_branches_test.rb.
#
# The reason is half the specification, and the more load-bearing half.
# Grading on the verdict alone cannot tell a branch the sweep protected
# from one git refused to delete by itself, and cannot tell a branch kept
# because the evidence says its work is unlanded from one kept because
# the evidence could not answer. REASONS is the closed vocabulary that
# makes those distinctions assertable, and the tables' own headers
# document it in the same terms.
