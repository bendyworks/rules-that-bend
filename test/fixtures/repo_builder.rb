# frozen_string_literal: true

# Shared machinery for the fixture repositories the stale-branch sweep is
# graded against. Subclasses define #build and the branches they need.
#
# Every repository built here is a throwaway, created under a temporary
# directory. A test's own is deleted when the test ends, and the build
# that .copy_to copies from when the process does. No branch name any fixture
# mentions is a branch of the repository this file is checked into, and
# nothing here reads or writes it.
#
# This file lives under test/fixtures/ rather than test/ so CI's
# test/*_test.rb glob does not run it as a suite of its own; it defines
# no tests.
#
# Three properties are load-bearing, and each exists because its absence
# once hid a real defect or would hide one now:
#
# 1. Setup reproduces the world; it does not repair it. Nothing here runs
#    `git remote set-head`. An earlier generation of these fixtures did,
#    which quietly corrected a stale refs/remotes/<remote>/HEAD before the
#    code under test ever saw it -- and so hid a default-branch bug
#    through two rounds of review. A closing `fetch --prune` is fine and
#    each fixture ends with one, because the sweep's own caller is
#    specified to have fetched first -- but that fetch is pinned with
#    remote.origin.followRemoteHEAD=never. Left unpinned, git 2.48 and
#    newer create refs/remotes/origin/HEAD during that fetch while older
#    git does not, so the fixtures would build differently on the two
#    gits CI might supply, and the newer one would be performing exactly
#    the repair this property forbids. Absence is the deliberate state:
#    the default branch is resolved from `ls-remote --symref`, which asks
#    the remote rather than a local cache of it.
#
# 2. Ambient git configuration is neutralized, and so is ambient git
#    ENVIRONMENT. Pointing GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL/GIT_CONFIG_SYSTEM at an empty
#    file covers only configuration that arrives through a file: the
#    GIT_CONFIG_COUNT/GIT_CONFIG_KEY_n/GIT_CONFIG_VALUE_n form bypasses
#    both, and core.hooksPath arriving that way is arbitrary script
#    execution during a build. The variables naming a repository are worse
#    still, because `git -C <dir>` does not override an inherited GIT_DIR
#    and Open3.capture3 MERGES its env hash into the parent's rather than
#    replacing it -- so a build inheriting one operates on whatever
#    repository it names, reporting success the whole way. NEUTRALIZED_KEYS
#    is therefore not a tidiness list; it is what keeps a build inside the
#    directory it created. The initial branch name is likewise passed
#    explicitly rather than inherited from init.defaultBranch: without it a
#    fixture does not merely drift, it collapses, because on a machine
#    defaulting to `master` the bare repo's HEAD names a branch that is
#    never created and the first push fails outright.
#
# 3. A built fixture is copied only through .copy_to, and never moved.
#    git records a repository's absolute path in its remote URL and in
#    the files that tie a second worktree to its clone, so a plain copy
#    fetches from and pushes to the original's bare repository, and the
#    row that depends on the worktree passes because git finds the
#    original's and not because the copy has one. BuiltFixture gives a
#    copy its own path in each of those files.
