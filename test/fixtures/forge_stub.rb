  # Hands CliTestCase's serving-stub seam a program to install as `gh`.
  #
  # The seam takes a path and copies it onto PATH, knowing nothing about
  # what language the program is written in, which is what this module
  # exists to keep true. The sweep runs gh with the swept repository as
  # the child's working directory, and a `#!/usr/bin/env ruby` line
  # resolved from a throwaway directory can find a version-manager shim
  # with no version to resolve: it prints its list of installed versions
  # and never runs the program at all. The sweep would read that as an
  # empty answer rather than as a failure, and grade every branch as
  # having no pull request.
  #
  # So what gets installed is a /bin/sh wrapper naming this run's own
  # interpreter and the stub by absolute path. Nothing about it depends
  # on where it is run from, and the stub itself stays an ordinary Ruby
  # file that can be run and read on its own.

    # What the stub answers for when no --repo is passed, which is the
    # ordinary case: gh resolves the repository from its working
    # directory and the sweep leaves that to it.
