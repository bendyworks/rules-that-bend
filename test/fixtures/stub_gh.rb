# Stand-in for the GitHub CLI, serving canned pull-request data to the
# sweep's forge tests, and canned pull-request and issue data to the
# safe-to-leave tests. Installed onto PATH under the name `gh` by
# CliTestCase's serving-stub seam, which also names the two logs it
# reports through.
#
# This file lives under test/fixtures/ rather than test/ so CI's
# test/*_test.rb glob does not run it as a suite of its own. Its own
# tests live in test/stub_gh_test.rb, and they run it the way the sweep
# does -- as a program on PATH -- rather than by loading it.
#
# It mimics the real CLI where the difference would change a verdict:
#
#   --head matches on branch NAME alone, because gh offers no way to
#   scope it to an owner. A fork's pull request therefore comes back
#   from a query about your own branch, which is why the sweep has to
#   read isCrossRepository rather than trusting the filter.
#
#   --state defaults to open, so a sweep that forgets --state all sees
#   no merged pull request at all and keeps everything.
#
#   --limit defaults to 30 and truncates in silence.
#
#   A query that matches nothing is an empty array and exit 0. A
#   failure is a message on stderr and exit 1 -- the shape the sweep
#   degrades on, and never confusable with an empty result.
#
#   STUB_GH_FAIL and STUB_GH_GARBAGE inject the two ways an answer can
#   be useless: a non-zero exit, and a clean exit carrying something
#   that is not JSON. Both are served, never refused, because the sweep
#   is required to degrade on each.
#
#   With no --repo, the real client answers for the repository it
#   resolves from its own working directory, which is the resolution the
#   sweep leaves to it. The data file's @cwd key stands for that.
#
# Everything else fails closed. An unserved subcommand, absent data, a
# repo the data does not describe, a --json field a record does not
# carry: each is recorded as a refusal, which fails the test that
# caused it. The alternative is answering a question this stub does not
# actually know, and a plausible empty answer is exactly what a sweep
# reads as "no pull request" -- the one conclusion these fixtures exist
# to keep it from reaching without evidence.
