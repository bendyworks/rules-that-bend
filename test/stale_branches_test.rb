# Checks the oracle tables under test/fixtures/ against the fixture
# repositories they describe, and both against the vocabulary they share.
#
# The tables are the specification bin/stale-branches is built against:
# one row per branch, naming the verdict the sweep must reach and the
# reason key its report must carry. The sweep is graded against them
# further down; the table half above carries more weight than it first
# appears, because each of these can go wrong while every other test
# stays green:
#
#   - the two halves must agree about which branches exist; a table that
#     forgets a branch silently asserts nothing about it, and one that
#     invents a branch would blame the sweep for the table's own mistake
#   - every reason the vocabulary documents must be demanded by a row, or
#     the rule behind it can be omitted from the sweep entirely with
#     nothing going red
#   - each table must demand a deletion from every stage that can reach
#     one, or a sweep implementing one stage scores full marks
#   - the loader's own guards must fire, since a guard that stops firing
#     yields a table specifying less than it appears to
#   - the fixtures must still build the structure the reasons rest on --
#     the worktree, the shadowing tags, the deleted remote refs
#
# Together those are what stops the tables from being gradable by a sweep
# nobody would ship, which is the failure the fixtures were rebuilt to
# close.

# A fixture build runs roughly a hundred git commands, several of them

# the throwaway repository it just created. Two mechanisms in git defeat
# that by default, and neither is visible at the call site:
#
# 1. `git -C <dir>` does not override an inherited GIT_DIR. Open3.capture3
#    merges its env hash into the parent's rather than replacing it, so a
#    build inheriting GIT_DIR operates on whatever repository that names
#    -- creating branches, deleting them, and pushing to that repository's
#    own remote, all reported as success.
# 2. GIT_CONFIG_COUNT/GIT_CONFIG_KEY_n/GIT_CONFIG_VALUE_n inject
#    configuration without going through any config file, so pointing
#    GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL and GIT_CONFIG_SYSTEM at an empty file does not
#    neutralize them. core.hooksPath arriving this way is arbitrary script
#    execution during a build.
#
# These tests pin the neutralization rather than the fixtures' verdicts,
# which is why they assert against a sentinel repository that no fixture
# names: the question is not whether the build is correct but whether
# anything outside its own temporary root can observe that it ran.
