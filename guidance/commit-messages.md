# Commit Message Style

> **Precedence:** this file is a shared default. If anything here
> conflicts with the project's own CLAUDE.md, rules files, or a team
> agreement, the project wins.

Commit messages follow one shape, adapted from
[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/):

```
type(scope): Title Case Outcome Description

The WHAT and the HOW, in as many paragraphs as needed.

BREAKING CHANGE: what breaks, when something does
Refs: ABC-123
Co-authored-by: Name <email>
```

Treat the description -- the part after the prefix -- as a **title**,
not a sentence. It answers WHY: the user-visible outcome or the reason
the change exists, in the most succinct, instantly understandable form.
It should be skim-readable in `git log --oneline`. Quickly
understandable beats grammatically complete; some excellent
descriptions are just two words.

## The type(scope) prefix

- `type` names the mechanism category: `feat`, `fix`, `build`, `chore`,
  `ci`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, or `revert`
  (see Reverts below).
- `scope` is optional: a short app-area noun in parentheses, e.g.
  `feat(marketplace):`. Keep scope names consistent within a project;
  drifting spellings (`marketplace` one week, `mktpl` the next) quietly
  erode the pattern's parseability.
- The prefix is the recommended default, not a hard requirement; a
  plain Title Case title is still acceptable. Be honest about the
  tradeoff, though: the structure's payoffs -- changelog generation,
  release automation, lint gates -- only accrue where a project carries
  the prefix on every commit. A team that wants that tooling should
  mandate the prefix in its own project rules.

## Descriptions

- Write for a teammate who knows the product but wasn't in the weeds
  of this change. Prefer the WHY / real-world outcome over the WHAT /
  code mechanism.
- Prefer Title Case noun phrases or a leading OUTCOME verb (`Limit`,
  `Prevent`, `Stop`, `Speed up`) over mechanism verbs (`Add`,
  `Update`, `Move`). The type already carries the mechanism category,
  which frees the description to carry the point of the change. In an
  unprefixed title, an outcome verb like `Fix` or `Prevent` does the
  type's job.
  - Strong: `feat(marketplace): Limit Public Search to Intended Fields`
  - Weak: `feat(marketplace): Add ransackable_attributes allowlists`
- Don't repeat the type as the description's leading verb.
  - Redundant: `fix(reports): Fix Broken CSV Export`
  - Better: `fix(reports): Broken CSV Export for Embedded Commas`

  The same logic makes `refactor` legitimate as a type even though it
  is a poor description verb: `refactor(billing): One Fee Calculation
  Path` says what the cleanup achieved; the prefix already says it was
  a refactor. `revert` works the same way: the type says a commit was
  undone, freeing the description to name what the tree is back to
  (see Reverts).
- Don't stack library jargon or internal nouns in the description. If
  a technical term is genuinely needed, it goes in the body; the
  description stays plain.
- No file lists, mechanism dumps, or "and also fix X" tail clauses. If
  the description needs an "and", it should usually be two commits; if
  the change genuinely can't be split, the description still names the
  single user-facing outcome and the body explains the rest.
- Keep the whole first line to roughly 72 characters; an unprefixed
  title should fit a tighter ~60-character skim target. A description
  that can't fit is a smell that the scope is too long or the commit
  too big.
- Read it aloud before committing: if a teammate couldn't tell what
  changed and why it matters, rewrite it.

## Bodies

- After the blank line, cover the WHAT and the HOW: which files and
  mechanisms changed, the technical details, and any non-obvious
  tradeoffs. Multiple paragraphs are fine. When the point of the
  change rests on in-repo machinery (e.g. a guard spec), spend a
  sentence or two saying what that machinery does before describing
  how the change alters it -- a body that only makes sense after
  opening the file it references has not carried its weight in
  `git log`.
- Keep the body focused on the permanent record: motivation,
  mechanism, tradeoffs. The strongest motivation names the concrete
  cost or risk of leaving the code as it was: "X and Y now mean the
  same thing" states a fact, while "keeping both invites drift" names
  the cost that justifies the commit. For a change that adds
  something new, the user-visible outcome is motivation enough.
- The commit is the reader's "after": behavior it contains takes
  present tense ("the report now pages at 100 rows"), and the
  behavior it replaces carries a label ("before this change, it
  loaded every row"), never a calendar word like "today". The
  writing-about-change guidance covers the rest.
- Reviewer pointers ("start with file X", "the key test to scrutinize
  is Y") and out-of-scope notes ("filed as ABC-123", "deferred to the
  next PR") belong in the PR description instead. Commits live in
  `git log` forever and are read in many contexts; PR-scoped guidance
  decays badly when separated from its PR. The footer's `Refs:` names
  the one issue this commit serves; cross-references to any other
  issue stay at the PR level.
- For word choice throughout the message, follow the Plain language
  rules in the code-comments guidance.

## Footers

Footers are git trailers -- `Token: value` lines after a blank line
following the body (a value may wrap onto continuation lines):

- `Refs: <issue-id>` names the tracker issue the commit serves, in
  that tracker's native form: `Refs: ABC-123`, `Refs: SC-123`,
  `Refs: #123`. Use `Refs:` rather than `Fixes`/`Closes` -- GitHub
  closes the referenced issue the moment a `Fixes`/`Closes` commit
  reaches the default branch, so reserve those for the rare commit
  where auto-close is the intent.
- `BREAKING CHANGE: <description>` (uppercase, per the spec) marks a
  breaking change. The spec also offers a `!` shorthand
  (`feat(api)!:`), but prefer the explicit footer: with a bare `!` and
  no footer, the spec routes the breaking-change description into the
  first line, displacing the outcome phrase.
- `Co-authored-by: Name <email>` credits co-authors, one trailer
  line per person (GitHub's documented spelling of the trailer).
- `Reverts: <sha>` names a reverted commit, one trailer line per
  commit, the same one-line-per-value form as `Co-authored-by:`.
  Use the full 40-character SHA -- short SHAs go ambiguous as a
  repo grows -- and read the trailers back with
  `git log --format='%(trailers:key=Reverts,valueonly)'`. The
  policy for revert commits lives in Reverts below.

## Reverts

A revert follows the same shape as any other commit, with type
`revert`, as the spec's
[FAQ answer on reverts](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#how-does-conventional-commits-handle-revert-commits)
recommends (the footer token here is `Reverts:`, not the FAQ's
`Refs:`):

```
revert: Full-Field Public Search

Rolling back the allowlist tightening: it broke saved searches for
existing marketplace users.

This reverts commit 676104e3e5f38e34b04e4f56581df8d6f6ef7a01.

Reverts: 676104e3e5f38e34b04e4f56581df8d6f6ef7a01
Refs: #123
```

- The description names the restored outcome -- what the tree is
  back to -- never the reverted commit's title, which is what git's
  default `Revert "<old title>"` carries and names only what was
  undone. Prefer a bare noun phrase; an outcome verb is fine when
  it does not repeat the type (see Descriptions). In an unprefixed
  title, a leading `Revert` or `Restore` does the type's job.
- Keep git's generated "This reverts commit <sha>." sentence in the
  body and write the why-prose around it. conventional-changelog's
  revert detection (the conventionalcommits preset) needs both that
  sentence and an unscoped `revert:` start to the first line -- a
  scope like `revert(marketplace):` silently turns detection off,
  so keep revert headers unscoped where that tooling matters.
- Revert commit-by-commit by default: `git revert A B C` produces
  one commit per SHA, each with its own generated sentence. A
  single commit carrying several `Reverts:` lines is the exception
  for commits that were one logical change (per Practices); git's
  `revert --no-commit` generates no message for it, so each "This
  reverts commit <sha>." sentence is written by hand.
- `Refs:` names the motivating issue when one exists -- the
  incident or bug that forced the revert.
- A generated revert message that is already pushed (GitHub's
  Revert button, a scripted rollback) stays as-is: pushed history
  is not rewritten for message shape (see Practices).

## Practices

- Prefer more, smaller, targeted commits over fewer, larger ones; each
  commit represents one logical change. A commit that seems to need
  two types is the same smell wearing a prefix: split it.
- If you cannot name a cost of leaving the code as it was, the change
  may not deserve a commit at all. Preparatory commits are the
  exception: a seam or an extraction is justified by the change it
  enables, not by the status quo.
- Generated messages are exempt from this shape: merge commits and
  bot commits keep their generators' formats, which are themselves
  conventions other tooling and readers rely on (`git log
  --merges`, bot changelogs). Reverts are not exempt (see Reverts).
- Never amend or rewrite pushed commits without an explicit request.
- **A pushed commit message cannot be edited without rewriting
  history, so check the visibility of the repository it is going to
  before writing it** (`gh repo view <owner>/<repo> --json
  visibility`). Unless the answer is `PRIVATE`, keep out anything that
  identifies a private source: names, other projects' tracker IDs,
  links, and figures that sit beside any of those. The project's own
  `Refs:` ID stays. The public-destinations guidance carries the full
  rule.

## Enforcing the prefix in CI

A team that mandates the prefix can enforce it in CI with a
dependency-free workflow check; the copyable, tested snippet and its
variants (squash-merge title lint, Dependabot prefixes, branch
protection) live in
[enforcing-commit-prefix.md](enforcing-commit-prefix.md), a setup
reference for humans that needs no session import.
