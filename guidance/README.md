# Engineering Guidance

Team-neutral engineering guidance for [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com),
extracted from how we work at [Bendyworks](https://bendyworks.com). Each
file is plain markdown you can wire into your own Claude sessions so the
practices apply to your work automatically.

| File | What it covers | Applies to |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`tdd.md`](tdd.md) | Test-first by default: spec first, watch it fail, then production code, then watch it pass -- and how to verify retroactively when that order slipped. | everything |
| [`spec-writing.md`](spec-writing.md) | RSpec defaults: syntax idioms, doubles vs real factory records, setup hygiene, minimal base factories with traits, which specs not to write, and titles that name behavior. | `spec/**/*` (path-scoped via frontmatter) |
| [`commit-messages.md`](commit-messages.md) | Conventional Commits shape (`type(scope):` prefix, trailer footers, a revert convention) with Title Case outcome descriptions that answer WHY, bodies that carry the what, the how, and the motivating cost, and what belongs in the PR description instead. | everything |
| [`enforcing-commit-prefix.md`](enforcing-commit-prefix.md) | A copyable, tested CI gate for the `type(scope):` prefix: dependency-free workflow snippet, squash-merge title-lint variant, Dependabot prefix config, and branch-protection notes. | CI setup reference for humans -- skip when wiring up session imports |
| [`code-comments.md`](code-comments.md) | Comments that state permanent intent -- invariants and constraints, not debugging narration -- plus plain language: no unexplained acronyms, no insider jargon, no session-coined names, analogy words that fit the construct's real category, and references to tracker items (issues, stories, epics) and pull requests that carry their looked-up title, not the ID alone. | everything |
| [`pull-requests.md`](pull-requests.md) | Small incremental PRs (300-line target, 400-line easy-review threshold), draft mode first with the draft as its own review, why-first cost-naming descriptions that link outside resources and name every issue or pull request they mention by its title, a PR owns the bugs it introduces, per-thread review replies, the merge as a human action by default with opt-in Session-Merge Mode, always naming a merge's direction, and stacked chains built as GitHub native stacks (a stack merge lands every layer up to and including its target, local branches brought current after each merge, the mainline kept clear while a stack is open), with a manual fallback where native stacks are unavailable. | everything |
| [`clean-and-green.md`](clean-and-green.md) | Zero lint offenses and zero test failures as the status quo, no suppression comments, and escalating to a human instead of ever calling a red suite acceptable; defines Full Verification Mode (the default) and opt-in Targeted Spec Verification Mode for where the full suite runs, and captures every gating run's output to a uniquely-named /tmp log that gets grepped instead of the run being repeated. | everything |
| [`verification-habits.md`](verification-habits.md) | Empiricism before assertion: verify library claims against installed source, never write unverified facts about people, check schemas and method signatures before use, look up identifiers such as full commit SHAs instead of completing them, question a setup step that prepares state for the code under test, and close a planned check only when it runs and passes. | everything |
| [`writing-about-change.md`](writing-about-change.md) | Tense that says which side of a change a sentence describes: "will" and "has been" in previews of unshipped work, present tense and "now" for what a commit or pull request contains, sides anchored to the change rather than the calendar ("before this change", never "today"), and a phrase search for previews. | everything |
| [`tracker-comments.md`](tracker-comments.md) | Tracker comments that survive plans falling through: intentions with owners and absolute dates, instructions the reader verifies, no relative time, and issues and pull requests named by title. | everything |
| [`client-messages.md`](client-messages.md) | Messages to the people who use or run the app, with the defaults a session reaches for when asked to be warm named so a draft skips them: an opener that grades the reader, sentences that announce a point or count the items before giving them, reassurance ahead of the explanation, the story of the search around an extra finding, a question buried under a softening tail, closing ritual, and a short list of filler words. Prescribes no greeting, sign-off, or voice. | projects whose developers message clients or stakeholders about the app |
| [`public-destinations.md`](public-destinations.md) | Private material stays out of public destinations: check a repository's visibility before the first commit message, pull request, issue, comment, or code comment bound for it and before the first push, keep names, other projects' tracker IDs, links, and identifiable figures from private sources out unless it is private, and stop on a leak that is already published instead of quietly editing it, with the remedy GitHub offers for each kind of write. | everything |
| [`rails-conventions.md`](rails-conventions.md) | Rails built-ins before custom code, standard foreign-key associations, domain queries named on the model, symbol-based enum usage, and avoiding ActiveRecord callbacks in new code. | Rails projects |
| [`ruby-style.md`](ruby-style.md) | Files that read top to bottom: the public interface first, one `private` section last (a project's own inline `private def` style wins), each helper below its first caller, new methods private unless something outside calls them, a whole-file reorder in its own move-only commit when touching a file laid out differently, and the two RuboCop settings (plus a to-do file for existing code) that make lint enforce it. | Ruby projects |
| [`environments.md`](environments.md) | Staging and production are separate datasets: frame smoke tests, bug repros, and QA hand-offs in scenario shape, never by production record IDs. | everything |
| [`browser-checks.md`](browser-checks.md) | A planned browser check against staging, production, or a third-party app: create the tab, park it on the sign-in screen (or run the check when the right role is already signed in and the check only reads, or park it on the sign-out control when the wrong role is), name the role, point the developer at the tab, and keep the check outstanding until it runs and passes instead of substituting other evidence. | projects checked in a browser: staging, production, or third-party apps |

Every file opens with the same precedence rule: **if it conflicts with
your project's own CLAUDE.md, rules files, or a team agreement, your
project wins.** These are defaults, not mandates.

## Ways to adopt

Pick whichever fits your team; all three are supported.

### 1. Use verbatim (clone + import)

Clone the repo and symlink it to the canonical location, so import
lines are identical across machines and copy-pasteable from docs:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bendyworks/rules-that-bend.git
ln -s "$PWD/rules-that-bend" ~/.claude/bendyworks-guidance
```

The link keeps the name `bendyworks-guidance` whatever the clone's
folder is called, so an existing clone made under the repository's
former name keeps working with the same import lines.

Then import from your personal `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (user-level
imports are not gated by any approval prompt):

```
@~/.claude/bendyworks-guidance/guidance/tdd.md
@~/.claude/bendyworks-guidance/guidance/commit-messages.md
```

`spec-writing.md` is shaped as a path-scoped rules file, so link it
into your rules directory instead and it will only apply when you're
working under `spec/`:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/rules
ln -s ~/.claude/bendyworks-guidance/guidance/spec-writing.md ~/.claude/rules/
```

Updates arrive with `git pull` in the clone. Remember that a pull can
change how your sessions behave; skim the diff.

### 2. Copy the files into your project

Copy the files into your repo as `.claude/rules/*.md` via a normal PR
your team reviews. Updates arrive the same way: a PR someone reads,
amends, or rejects. Nothing changes behavior without a reviewed merge,
and once merged the files are yours to edit.

Copying also sidesteps every external-import mechanic below: no
approval prompt, no symlink, no path variance across machines.

### 3. Fork

It's [MIT](../LICENSE). Copy, reshape, and keep whatever serves your
team. If a change is generally useful, we'd love a PR back -- but
that's optional.

## Overriding and customizing

You don't need to fork to disagree. The precedence preamble in every
file means a deviation written in your own project CLAUDE.md or rules
wins over anything here. State the deviation where your team's rules
live ("we use build_stubbed, not create, for model specs") and Claude
follows yours.

## Keep it lean

Claude adheres best when a session's total guidance stays around 200
lines; imported files count against that budget. Import only the files
you'll actually use, and feel free to trim in-repo copies -- deleting
sections your team doesn't need is customizing, not vandalism.

## Troubleshooting imports

**Imported guidance isn't taking effect.** Imports fail silently: a
wrong path produces no error -- the `@path` line just sits in context
as plain text and the file never loads. To check what actually loaded,
run `/memory` in an interactive session; every loaded file is listed
there. Common causes:

- Typo in the path, or the clone/symlink doesn't exist yet. Verify
  with `ls ~/.claude/bendyworks-guidance/guidance/`.
- The `@path` is wrapped in backticks or a code block. Those are
  intentionally not parsed as imports -- that's how this README shows
  import syntax without triggering it. Write the line bare in your
  own CLAUDE.md.
- The import chain is more than 4 hops deep (Claude Code's recursion
  limit).

**I declined the "external file" approval prompt and now imports never
load.** When a project-level CLAUDE.md imports a file outside the
project root, Claude Code asks for approval once per project.
Declining disables those imports permanently for that project, with no
re-prompt and no error. To recover, quit Claude Code sessions in that
project, then in `~/.claude.json` under
`projects."<absolute project path>"` either set
`"hasClaudeMdExternalIncludesApproved": true`, or set
`"hasClaudeMdExternalIncludesWarningShown": false` to be asked again
next session.

Note: that prompt only applies to imports written in a checked-in
project CLAUDE.md. Imports in your personal `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (the
clone + import setup above) are not gated by it, and in-repo copies
never leave the project root at all.
