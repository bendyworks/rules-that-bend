# Rules That Bend

Working agreements, engineering guidance, and skills for developing with
[Claude Code](https://code.claude.com), from
[Bendyworks](https://bendyworks.com). They grew out of many sessions of
day-to-day work with Claude across many projects.

Every rule here bends: each guidance file is a shared default, and your
project's own rules win wherever the two disagree. Take what fits: import a
single guidance file, copy one skill, or install the whole plugin.

It all keeps evolving. It works for us, but expect rough edges --
issues and pull requests are welcome (see [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md)).

This repository was formerly `bendyworks/claude-skills`. GitHub
redirects the old name here only while no other repository takes it, so
that name stays retired.

## Install

The skills install as a Claude Code plugin. From inside Claude Code:

```
/plugin marketplace add bendyworks/rules-that-bend
/plugin install bendyworks@bendyworks
```

The repository name is only where the marketplace is fetched from: the
marketplace and its plugin both register as `bendyworks`, which is the
name you type from then on. Installed skills are namespaced: invoke them
as `/bendyworks:<skill>`, e.g. `/bendyworks:gauntlet`. Claude also
triggers them automatically when a task matches a skill's description.

To pick up updates later:

```
/plugin marketplace update bendyworks
```

If you added the marketplace under its former name, everything keeps
working through GitHub's redirect. To point it at the new name instead,
remove it and install again:

```
/plugin marketplace remove bendyworks
/plugin marketplace add bendyworks/rules-that-bend
/plugin install bendyworks@bendyworks
```

## Skills

| Skill | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `gauntlet` | Harden the quality of a branch that already accomplishes your goal and you now want to improve. This is a Rails-oriented multi-front quality pass on a feature branch whose specs and lint already pass. True superset of Anthropic's built-in /code-review skill. Includes: code review, then parallel audits (cruft, idioms, test quality, validation bypass, security), consolidated into one punch list. Clear-cut findings get fixed without stopping; the judgment calls come back to you as one batch of questions. On GitHub Issues, where the project has priority labels, each follow-up issue it drafts shows one proposed priority with a reason, confirmed when you approve the filing. |
| `plan-issue` | Plan a story end-to-end: interview, research, propose a plan with steps for a full life cycle, challenge it from a fresh perspective, record it, work the to-dos, and finish after ship. On GitHub Issues it marks the issue `in progress` when a session picks it up, where the repository has that label and the project has not declined it (it offers to create a missing one), so parallel sessions can see which issues are taken. Where the project has priority labels, an issue it drafts shows one proposed priority with a reason and is filed once you confirm it, and an issue nobody has judged gets a proposal when a session picks it up. |
| `finished-issue-housekeeping` | Post-ship cleanup once a story is merged and deployed (just merged, on a project in Deploy-on-Merge Mode): finalize the plan file, move the issue to Done (on GitHub, close it and remove its `in progress` label), prune branches, save the story's lessons as rules or skills, tidy memory and task lists, run an approval-gated permission-prompt sweep that can propose additions to the project's `.claude/settings.json`, and commit the files the pass wrote: to the default branch where the project declares that, otherwise on a draft pull request. |
| `architecture-survey` | Identify the biggest improvement opportunities in your application - prioritizing the largest and most daunting pain points you've been paying a large maintenance tax on already. Domain-first architectural-simplification survey of a mature codebase, producing a ranked, tracker-ready refactoring backlog. Can create an epic of fixes in your story tracker of choice. |
| `markdown-to-pdf` | Convert Markdown files to clean, print-styled PDFs. |
| `change-highlights` | Show a client what a change does to something they rely on, in a before/after PDF per recipient that leads with the fix they care about, including one that only affects future records. Refuses to write a PDF whose text names another tenant on its deny list, and lists every image to check by eye. Capture templates are Rails-first. |
| `linear` | Read and write Linear issues via a bundled CLI (create, comment, search, transition) instead of raw GraphQL. Requires Ruby and a `LINEAR_API_TOKEN` env var. |
| `dependabot-batch` | Triage, verify, and (behind opt-in dials) merge and deploy a batch of open Dependabot PRs. |
| `bug-cluster-ledger` | Mine a time window of tracker issues and cluster them upward to root causes per subsystem, with prevention analysis. Used by architecture-survey. |
| `app-wind-down` | Wind down a hosted app safely and reversibly: caretaker mode first, then hibernation to ~$0 with full restore assets. |
| `parallel-checkouts` | Run several full clones of one project side by side, each with its own dev server and full test suite running at the same time as the others. Prepares a project once (its database names, Redis databases, and pinned ports, or its Compose project and published ports, follow a per-checkout identity), then adds, removes, or moves checkouts and shares Claude Code's project memory between them. Rails-first; covers projects whose Postgres and Redis run natively or in Docker Compose. |
| `targeted-specs` | Run just the specs a feature branch plausibly affects instead of the full local suite, leaning on CI for the full run. Escalates to "this branch needs a full run" when blast-radius files are touched, announces the subset for your veto, and never subsets lint. Rails/RSpec-first. |

## Engineering guidance

Beyond skills, [`guidance/`](guidance/README.md) holds team-neutral
engineering guidance files -- test-driven development discipline,
commit-message style, pull-request practices, and more -- that you can
import into your own CLAUDE.md, copy into a project's
`.claude/rules/`, or fork outright. Every file defers to your project's own rules on
conflict. See [guidance/README.md](guidance/README.md) for setup,
overriding, and troubleshooting.

## Requirements

- Claude Code with plugin support.
- A GitHub-hosted repository and the GitHub CLI (`gh`), installed and
  authenticated. Everything that reads pull requests or GitHub issues
  goes through `gh`: the commands the skills and guidance give a
  session, `stale-branches`, and `gh-issue-sync`. `targeted-specs` uses
  it only as a fallback when resolving a repo's default branch. A
  GitHub Enterprise host counts, since `gh` reaches it through its own
  host setting, though stacked pull requests may not be enabled there.
  Linear and Shortcut are supported as issue trackers, and a project
  tracked there still needs GitHub for its pull requests. A repository
  hosted anywhere else is not supported;
  [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#github-is-required) says what
  supporting one would take.
- The bundled CLIs (`linear`, `gh-issue-sync` used by `plan-issue`
  and `finished-issue-housekeeping` on GitHub-tracked repos, and
  `stale-branches`) require Ruby 3.x on your PATH (macOS and Linux; on
  Windows use WSL). The `linear` CLI also needs a `LINEAR_API_TOKEN`
  environment variable; `gh-issue-sync` delegates auth to `gh`.
- `stale-branches` reports which local branches have already landed on
  the default branch, and deletes them with `--delete`. It needs git
  2.38 or newer for `merge-tree --write-tree`, the check that
  recognizes a squash-merged branch, and refuses to run on older git
  rather than reporting verdicts it could not reach. It also reads pull
  requests through `gh`, which is what keeps a branch somebody still has
  open from being deleted. When `gh` cannot read them it says so in a
  warning and refuses `--delete` outright, because the verdicts then
  cut both ways: a branch whose merge conflicts is kept for want of an
  answer rather than because its work is unlanded, and a branch whose
  work has already landed while its own pull request is still open is
  marked DELETE. `--offline` is how you ask for a sweep on local
  evidence alone and mean it.
- `gauntlet` is tuned for Ruby on Rails projects (RSpec, RuboCop, Pundit).
  It runs elsewhere, but its audit prompts are Rails-flavored. It would be easy to re-focus a forked copy if you wish.
- `markdown-to-pdf` needs a Chromium-based browser or wkhtmltopdf, plus a
  markdown converter (kramdown gem, pandoc, or python-markdown).
- `change-highlights` needs Ruby 2.6 or newer (the macOS system Ruby works)
  and a Chromium-based browser (Chrome, Chromium, Brave, or Edge).

## Upgrading Rails?

For Rails and Ruby upgrade work we use and recommend the excellent skills
from OmbuLabs / FastRuby.io (`rails-upgrade`, `dual-boot`,
`rails-load-defaults`):

```
/plugin marketplace add ombulabs/claude-skills
```

We deliberately don't republish those here -- install them from the source.
We have our own wrapping functionality that we need to separate out cleanly before publishing here.
