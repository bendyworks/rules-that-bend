# Park the user-level CLAUDE.md for the length of one command, so a
# headless dry run started inside it cannot read the author's personal
# rules. Every checkout of this repo on a machine shares one config
# directory, so the park is guarded by a lock that names its holder.
# CONTRIBUTING.md's dry-run section says when to use this, with or
# without `--setting-sources project`.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/park-claude-md.sh [--none-ok] -- <command> [args...]
#   scripts/park-claude-md.sh --status
#   scripts/park-claude-md.sh --recover
#
#   --none-ok   run the command even when there is no CLAUDE.md to
#               park (for a machine that has never had one)
#   --status    say whether the file is parked, and by whom
#   --recover   put back a file whose holder is no longer running
#               (after a crash or kill -9), without the checksum check,
#               or clear a lock left with no owner record for over a
#               minute
#
# The config directory is $CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR when set, else ~/.claude:
# the directory Claude Code reads the user-level CLAUDE.md from.
#
# While parked, the file lives inside CLAUDE.md.park-lock/ beside the
# original, next to an owner record naming the checkout, process ID,
# and process start time of the session that parked it, and a
# fingerprint of the parked file. The start time tells a live holder
# from a reused process ID; the fingerprint shows whether the parked
# copy changed before it is put back.
# No -e: every failure here is checked by hand, and wait must hand back
# the command's status for the script to exit with.
